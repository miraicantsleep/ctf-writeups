# nah id win.

**server is needed to host the program, also provide libc of the server (or dont to increase difficulty LOL)**

## Description
As the strongest problem in history faced off against the strongest pwner of today, they asked it: "Are you the shell because you are /bin/sh? Or are you /bin/sh because you are the shell?"

The pwner laughed. "Stand proud. You are strong." said the pwner. At this moment, the pwner used their domain expansion.

"DOMAIN EXPANSION. ret2libc."

The problem began using reverse pwn technique, but it wasn't enough. The domain was simply too strong. However, the problem had not yet used its domain expansion.

"DOMAIN EXPANSION: Return restrictions." The problem said, and the domain was instantly shattered.

"Nah, I'd win." The problem said, and the pwner was dealt with.


## Flag
`wxmctf{d0main_expansion:ret2libc.}`

## Solution
Use a return and then just regular ret2libc LOL 

## Note from solver
It is not me (mirai), that writes this. I just find this thing so funny i had to put it here. The flag in the server is literally stored in this README.md file.
